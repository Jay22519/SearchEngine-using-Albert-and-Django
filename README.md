# SearchEngine-using-Albert-and-Django
This is a web application of search engine where you can search any query for more than 10k Indian personality. Data for Indian personality has been scrapped from Wikipedia 

For now I've added the notebook code which contains the main logic for finding answer using ALBERT . Soon I'll add a Django project folder which contains this code logic plus a simple web interface for this application
